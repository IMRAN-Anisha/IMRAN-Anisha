👋 Hi there! I’m [Anisha](https://imran-anisha.github.io/PortFolio/index.html)

A student, developer, and problem-solver, passionate about blending creativity and technology to build meaningful experiences.

I love creating things — websites, ideas, and tools that make everyday life a bit simpler. 
I’m passionate about tech, design, and building projects that help people learn, connect, and grow.

Currently exploring everything from front-end development with React and Tailwind, to back-end tools like Flask and SQLite. 
Some recent projects include Community Connect, a volunteer matching web app, 
and BlueByte, an educational platform co-founded to make coding more accessible to students.

When not coding, you’ll find me exploring philosophy, amazed by the stars, or sipping coffee.
— Always exploring how technology and creativity influence each other. Deeply curious about the future of AI, ethics, and tech in education.

🌱 Currently learning: Next.js, React, and UI/UX design

💡 Favourite topics: productivity, and tech for good

🎯 Goal: to build software that inspire and make a difference
